**Practicing With Git and GitHub**

Hello, friends!

I'm *finally* moving my projects off my machine and onto GitHub--into the wild! I've put it off long enough, out of unfounded fear and insecurities, but will no longer let those things stop me. :) 

Looking forward to *making mistakes* and **fixing** them!

Forever learning,
Megan
